# 🩺 MedInstructAI – Multilingual Medical Report Explainer

MedInstructAI is an intelligent voice and text-based assistant that helps users understand complex medical reports in simple, layman-friendly language. It can read reports from typed text, PDFs, or images and explain them clearly using a Large Language Model (LLM). The assistant supports multilingual responses, voice-based interaction, and alerts users about serious medical risks.
